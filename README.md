# Web design
## Introduction
For this course i will design a prototype that will improve closed captions for Marie van Driessche, a person who was born deaf. I will meet 3 times with her to test and discuss solutions.

## Usability tests & progression

### Learn how to test and use the results to improve your app
I've created a small prototype that I used for testing each week. I didn't try to create everything at once. There problably won't be enough time to test them properly anyway. 

My concept has both sound indicators and custom made CC's, but I knew that focussing on them both would take to much time, so I decided to focus my own test on the light aspect and ask questions to understand how this would work when used with CC's (in text). I also took notes when other people did their tests, because they focust on the CC's themselfs. I could simply use their test results to improve my own concept. This not only saved time, but I also iterated both of my functionalities while only testing the light aspect myself.

#### Most notable iterations
I have iterated several different aspects of my design.

##### Light indicators
###### Colors
The light indicators first had a static green color. Marie thought this green meant it inidcated something mysterious. I changed this color to be dynamic with a different meaning. Each main character now has his own color and side characters have a more neutral yellow color.

###### Displaying Rithm
Rithm was first proposed as a Karaoke style CC's where you would see a dot indicating rithm and words could be stretched. This was too big of a job so I decided to handle it differenly. The rithm of music can now be seen through the light indicators. However Marie thought using the same indicator for FX, music and dialogue was too much so I included a switch where you can select either FX and music or dialogue.
