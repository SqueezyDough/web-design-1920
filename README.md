# Web design
## Introduction
For this course i will design a prototype that will improve closed captions for Marie van Driessche, a person who was born deaf. I will meet 3 times with her to test and discuss solutions.

## Usability tests & progression
You can find all information in my [wiki](https://github.com/SqueezyDough/web-design-1920/wiki/Usability-tests)!

## Learning goals
### Learn how to apply design principles
exclusive design

### Undestanding and applying user needs

### Learn how to test and use the results to improve your app
I've created a small prototype that I used for testing each week. I didn't try to create everything at once. There problably won't be enough time to test them properly anyway. 

My concept has both sound indicators and custom made CC's, but I knew that focussing on them both would take to much time, so I decided to focus my own test on the light aspect and ask questions to understand how this would work when used with CC's (in text). I also took notes when other people did their tests, because they focust on the CC's themselfs. I could simply use their test results to improve my own concept. This not only saved time, but I also iterated both of my functionalities while only testing the light aspect myself.

#### Most notable iterations
I have iterated several different aspects of my design.

##### Light indicators
###### Colors
The light indicators first had a static green color. Marie thought this green meant it inidcated something mysterious. I changed this color to be dynamic with a different meaning. Each main character now has his own color and side characters have a more neutral yellow color.

###### Displaying Rithm
Rithm was first proposed as a Karaoke style CC's where you would see a dot indicating rithm and words could be stretched. This was too big of a job so I decided to handle it differenly. The rithm of music can now be seen through the light indicators. However Marie thought using the same indicator for FX, music and dialogue was too much so I included a switch where you can select either FX and music or dialogue.

##### Closed captions
I designed the closed captions using test results from other students and I did several proposals how CC would work with the light indicators. I came to the following **Requirement list**:
- Closed captions should include the names of the person who is speaking
- Captions as 'scary background music' should be replaced with something like 'incoming danger' or skipped entirely.
- The color of the name in the closed caption is the same as the light indicator to let Marie know that light / sound comes from that character
- You can play with the CC's font-size to indicate a high volume for example.
- You can add playful animations to give the CC's more emotion/meaning.

## Conclusion
I think this course has challenged me to really get to know your user to the last detail, so you can create an appropriate (or rather tailored) design. I compare it with soemone who goes to a tailor. You try to give her something that exacty matches that users's propertions, or needs in this case. I think I have done that in just the few weeks I've had to make my design. Obviously it isn't finished or perfect in any way. There's still work to do, but this course scope is only the first 3/4 weeks of your design process. 

I think this course is not about you final product per se, but about creating rapid prototypes that do nothing more than test exactly what you want to test, taking criticism, improving your overall concept and create a new version of your prototype that again only do what you need it to do for the next test. I've done that in my tests. To be precise I only tested half of it while I let the others test the other half.

Testing remotely was tricky however. I feel like I get just a portion of the real experience. I can't see where my user is looking at, she cant think up loud, and just give her thoughts afterwards, because she can't both do sign language and interact with the product at the same time. For her it was a very intensive experience, or so I've heard. I also have to think about not asking too much at the same time, since what I'm asking first has to go through 3 different channels, the interpreters and herself. I also can't ask something while see is using my prototype, because, again, she can't do sign language and interact with the product. I wonder if we had tested locally, this would've easier. It did make me a better tester nonetheless. Learning how to handle usability testing in more difficult situations has made me better prepared for future tests. It's is a good addition to the CMD test package I've been practising for the last couple of years. But I don't think it will ever be my favourate task.
