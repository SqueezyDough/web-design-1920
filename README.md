# Web design
## Introduction
For this course i will design a prototype that will improve closed captions for Marie van Driessche, a person who was born deaf. I will meet 3 times with her to test and discuss solutions.

## Usability tests & progression
You can find all information in my [wiki](https://github.com/SqueezyDough/web-design-1920/wiki/Usability-tests)!

## Learning goals
### Learn how to apply design principles
exclusive design

### Undestanding and applying user needs

### Learn how to test and use the results to improve your app
#### Usability tests
I've created a small prototype thta I used for testing each week. I didn't try to create everything at once. My concept has both sound indicators and custom made CC's, but I knew that focussing on them both would take to much time, so I decided to focus my own test on the light aspect and ask questions to understand how this would work when used with CC's. I also took notes when other people did their tests, because they focust on the CC's themselfs. I could simply use their test results to improve my own concept. This not only saved time, but I also iterated both of my functionalities while only testing the light aspect myself.

#### Rapid prototyping
