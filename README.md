# Web design
## Introduction
For this course i will design a prototype that will improve closed captions for Marie van Driessche, a person who was born deaf. I will meet 3 times with her to test and discuss solutions. 

## Maries Profile
Marie is a web designer who works at the NCRV. Marie was born deaf and so her mothertongue is Dutch sign language, but she also understands Dutch and English. What was important to understand is that `sound` is an abstract concept for her. She nows what it is, but because she has never heard anything, it's hard to get a precise picture of sound. In video anything that refers to sound doesn't mean much for her. For example, when a movie says `Scary background music` in its closed caption, she has no good understanding of what a scary background music is.

### Testing hypotheses
#### Different voice pitches can't translate to sign language
It can, interpreters use mimics and face expressions to add emotions / picth differences.

#### Closed captions don't always explain what is going on in the background.
Yes, for deaf people some captions do not make any sense. Captions such as `scary background music` can't be interpreted by someone who has never heard music to begin with. Which doesn't mean they can't experience sound in some way. Displaying rithm can provide extra context to a scenario. When the music is loud, like in a cinema, see can feel vibrations coming from the speakers, which also give the scenario extra depth. For example, it can indicate loud music playing in a bar, which tells her people can't hear eachother very well.

#### Text or emoji's can help to visualise emotion
It can, but you should be careful. Emotions are subjective and so interpreted differently per individual. A winking emoji can mean lots of things. Also color coded text can be easily misinterpreted. Colors as red can mean loud or angry for example. Colors like green and blue are even harder to define.
